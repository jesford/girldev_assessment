    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <div id="mainblock">

      <p id="firstp">The majority of my past programming projects have been related to doing astronomy, but I've been working hard lately to start applying my programming skills to other realms - like website development and playing with public data on the internet.</p>

      <h2>Science Research Projects</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2295">Studying Galaxy Clusters with Gravitational Lensing</a>: This ongoing project is a statistical analysis of around 20,000 clusters of galaxies, and over a million individual galaxies, using a technique called weak gravitational lensing. Lensing is a purely statistical way of measuring masses using the way that light from distant galaxies is deflected. I've written thousands of lines of python code (a language I've transitioned to over the last 1.5 years), which I integrate with C programs when I need speed. I employ techniques such as bootstrapping (for error bars and covariance matrices), randomization (to check for systematics), and parallel processing (with openMP).</li>
          <li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3698">Magnified Galaxies</a>: This was an analysis of the dark matter halos of 44 galaxy clusters using > 30,000 background galaxies that were being gravitationally <i>magnified</i>, a signal that can only be teased out of the data through statistical averaging over a huge ensemble of data. I programmed thousands of lines of IDL and C to do the measurement, fit and compare different theoretical models, and estimate uncertainties using the jackknife method (similar to bootstrapping).</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/~heymans/step/mirror_size_simulations.html">Image Simulations at NASA JPL</a>: This 2007 summer project was when I first learned basic programming (outside of a university class) as well as how to use the command line on a linux machine. I coded some small IDL programs to simulate the relative image quality that could be achieved for space-based telescopes of different sizes (ie, prices) to help plan the requirements for a future mission.</li>
        </ul>


      <h2>Independent Skill-Building Projects</h2>

      <p>I have used <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to improve my knowledge of some languages and applications - I've completed all the lessons on: HTML & CSS, Python, How to use APIs with Python, Dwolla API. Lately I've been watching these Data Science <a href="https://class.coursera.org/datasci-001/lecture/preview">video lectures</a> from Coursera, and trying to follow along with the lessons. The lesson I'm currently working on uses python to process data from Twitter. I know I could make better progress in general if I had someone to help direct me when I get stuck, so I'm really hoping that the <font color="pink">GirlDev</font> Mentorship can be added to this list of projects!</p>
