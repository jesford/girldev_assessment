    <h1>Mentoring Groups</h1>

    <div id="mainblock">

      <p id="firstp">I am hoping to join the <strong>Databases and Big Data</strong> group!</p> 

      <h2>Why Big Data?</h2>

      <p>I first became interested in Data Science last sping, when I organized a graduate student career workshop, as part of the Canadian Astronomical Society's annual <a href="http://casca2013.phas.ubc.ca/?q=welcomepage">conference</a>. I invited several local speakers to give talks on "non-traditional" careers that might be possible for physicists or astronomers. I was particularly struck by one talk by a former physicist who had transitioned into data science. His description of various data science projects he had worked on sounded really cool. I realized that the scientific and technical skills that I've built while doing astrophysics research are actually quite relevant in many other areas. </p>

      <h2>Where am I now?</h2>

      <p>Writing algorithms to analyze data from large surveys, constructing and fitting models to the data, estimating uncertainties, worrying about underlying sampling distributions and correcting for biases, investigating sources of systematic error, handling and organizing inhomogeneous catalogues of data, finding optimal ways to display new findings, and presenting results through oral presentations and written articles... These are all a part of what I work on every day. I'm very keen to investigate new applications of these skills beyond the academic realm.</p>

      <h2>Where am I going?</h2>

      <p>Over the past year I have tried to self-educate myself in data science, mainly through reading, watching online course videos, and trying to work through some of their assignments. I've decided that my next step needs to involve a more structured program, leading to a product that gives me direct data science experience, ideally with some mentorship oversight. I was researching actually enrolling in an online <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses#!/Data%20Science">course</a>, and was starting to prepare an application for the <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science Fellowship</a>, when I stumbled across this meetup group. This <font color="pink">GirlDev</font> mentorship program is precisely what I'm looking for, and I am really excited to devote myself to this group project!</p>

      <p>The bottom line is that I have strong scientific skills, and now I really need to learn the <i>practical tools</i> of a data scientist.</p>
